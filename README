dependencies:
it depends on libevent > 2.0, which can be found at http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/.

compilation:
type make and compilation of the single takes place.
linkage will produce a dynamic binary called libevent-longpolling.

run:
execute this generated binary.
to check that everything runs smooth, do the following:
- consume first: wget -v http://127.0.0.1:8888/consumer/first_queue
- then produce: curl -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -d "hello world" http://127.0.0.1:8888/producer/first_queue

usage:
users may have two distinct roles:
- consumer: it makes HTTP requests to libevent-longpolling to receive content generated by a producer
- producer: it makes HTTP POST request to send messages to consumer
A message consists in an opaque body and a content-type. Content-Type supplied by producer will be sent
in response later sent to consumer.
Long-polling term refers to the fact that requests done by consumer are blocked by libevent-longpolling
as long as no message is available. When a message is sent by producer, consumer request is unblocked by
responding to it.
Binding between consumer and producer is called a topic and its value is part of the URI:
- a consumer makes requests on /consumer/[topic]
- a producer pushes bodies on /producer/[topic]
Topic creation is implicit: if a consumer asks for messages on a non existing topic, this one will be
created. The same holds for producers.
A topic may be purged by making an HTTP request on /purge/[topic].
Bound TCP address is 0.0.0.0:8888, meaning that every IP address your machine holds will be usable to
connect to libevent-longpolling.
Interested readers can directly look at the code, it is less than 300 lines of clean C :p

pros:
- this kind of pubsub mecanism will pass through enterprise's proxies, no reversed TCP connection is
needed
- if a timeout occurs (either due to an intermediate element, either due to the consumer HTTP stack
impletation), one just has to make the same request again

known issues:
- no special care has been taken regarding HTTP requests: GET or POST or whatever, no check is done
- URL parsing is partly taken from libevent HTTP Request-URI parsing and done uncarefully using strstr.
- really should implement connection close callback from libevent
